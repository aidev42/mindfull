Bugs to fix:

1) if you delete app while activity is still working gets into bad state, can fix by instead of resetting spheres on first initial Init of Main:
  - each login end any open acitivity and reset sphere names to defaults
  - and on logout end any open activity? (might not need this actually)
2) angular-chart.js is not most up to date version, possible causing issues as it seems creating two charts on one page/controller was not possible


Next steps:

1) On history page add ability to edit times and manually create new items
